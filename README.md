# Codeforces Solutions by Hafizur Rahman

Welcome to my Codeforces problem-solving repository!  
Here, I store solutions to the problems I solve from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Hafizur-Rahman-SD).

I created this repo to keep track of my progress, improve my coding skills, and help others who are learning competitive programming.

## 📌 Why I Made This Repository

- To practice coding every day 🧠  
- To become faster and better at problem solving ⌛  
- To keep all my Codeforces codes in one place 🗂️

---

## 🧾 How It’s Organized

- Each file is named using the problem code and name.
- Solutions are written in different languages (C, Python, Java any other languages).


## 🚀 My Goal

- Solve at least **5 problems per week**
- Practice easy → medium → hard gradually
- Learn new algorithms and data structures
